Everdamned is a lore-friendly and gameplay-focused vampirism overhaul. It was designed to offer the player more and deeper ways of interacting with the curse of Vampirism, in a way that augments core gameplay loop without completely imposing itself over it (hopefully). 

Features include, but not limited to:

[ul]
[li]Blood as resource - [b]Vitae[/b], with own resource bar[/li]
[li]Soft, but powerful incentives to act like a Vampire, enabled by the presence of Vitae.[/li]
[li]Multiple systems of organic progression - [b]Vampiric Rank[/b] (Age), [b]Vampirism[/b] skill tree, and more.[/li]
[li][b]Combat Draining[/b] with brand new animations to complement the gameplay[/li]
[li]Charm feeding system for role playing opportunities that also mesh well with gameplay goals[/li]
[li]Heavily reworked Vampire Lord perk tree[/li]
[li]Ways to unleash and gain control over the inner Beast[/li]
[li]Core mechanics implemented without Papyrus, so no drops in performance or added save bloat[/li]
[li]Hotkeys to reduce keybind bloat in a natural manner[/li]
[li]configurable through MCM (to some extent)[/li]
[/ul]
      and more



DISCLAIMER - This mod is heavily inspired by the general vibe of [b]Vampire: The Masquerade[/b] and draws on features from MissLeeches' [b]Vampiric Thirst[/b] and Enai's [b]Sacrosanct[/b]. Both of these mods are long-time favorites of mine. The first and only mod I'd created before Everdamned was a compatibility patch so I can play them together. With time, I began tweaking things here and there, keeping the plugin in a dedicated folder called [i][b]Sacrosanct tweaks[/b]. [/i]At some point it became clear that my appetites outgrew a mere compatibility patch, and this project commenced.

This mod is a work of its own, and all features that got carried over from [b]Vampiric Thirst[/b] and [b]Sacrosanct[/b] are expanded and reworked from the ground up. From Vampiric Thirst Everdamned inherits [b]Disciplines [/b]and [b]Seduction [/b]mechanic. From Sacrosanct, Everdamned borrows [b]Hemomancy [/b]and [b]Blue Blood[/b], as well as several mortal and Vampire Lord spells and abilities. Most things that were ported over were left with their original names for clarity and transparency, but may have different effects/visuals.


[b](Un)Life as a Vamire[/b]

As the name suggests, Everdamned imagines vampiric condition as an eternal curse. You are now faster, stronger and tougher than ever before, can (potentially) bend mere mortals to your will, ageing only grows your powers and you also get to live forever. How is this a curse, you ask? 
The Daedric nature of the curse dampens connection to the Divines, rendering you void of their grace. Your skin is now extremely susceptible to sunlight, and you cannot be healed by Restoration effects.  
Meet what vampires sometimes refer to as the Beast, your new metaphorical companion. Its urges make you into a creature of insatiable bloodlust, that can only be curtailed briefly. Controlling it will inform your decisions for the rest of your - eternal - existence.
Moreover, the aforementioned benefits only develop overtime, while the negatives are front loaded. A newborn vampire has little edge over its former kin, and has to grapple with new existential challenges straight away. 

Everdamned tries to flesh out and bring these challenges to the forefront in a way that is engaging, rather than tedious and constricting. This is achieved with introduction of a new resource, called [b]Vitae[/b] - essentially, a blood reserve. It is leveraged to transform the matter of your vampiric nutrition from a simple chore to a thrilling hunt with long-term benefits and role play opportunities.  Be a ravenous beast, a dapper charmer/temptress, an unseen shadow or all of that combined to quench your thirst and keep a healthy diet. As you grow more powerful, sunlight become less oppressive, but will always remain an obstacle to be mindful of. In absence of Restoration healing, you can rely on the stolen blood and lifesteal effects to regenerate Health, or work your way up to making it effective again.

There is a number of baseline characteristics and powers that all vampires share:

[ul]
[li][b]Poison and Disease resistance[/b]: Vampiric blood gives you [b]100% Resistance [/b]to poisons and disease.[/li]
[li][b]Moonlit Waters: [/b]You cannot drown underwater, and when Messer and Secunda shine bright, you can thread on their reflection.[/li]
[li][b]Resist Frost[/b]: Your undead body possesses a [b]20% Frost [/b]resistance, when you are [b]Sated[/b]. As it grows more desiccated and lifeless, this effect increases up to [b]50% [/b]when [b]Bloodstarved[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Weakness to Fire[/b]: At the same time, it begins to catch fire more easily. You are [b]20% [/b]weaker to [b]Fire [/b]when [b]Sated[/b]. This effect increases up to [b]50%[/b] when [b]Bloodstarved[/b]. [/li]
[li][b]Weakness to Sunlight[/b]: In sunny weather, [b]Health[/b], [b]Magicka[/b] and [b]Stamina[/b] are lowered by [b]25 (Sated) - 100 (Bloodstarved) [/b]points. In direct sunlight, their regeneration is halted, and[b] Vitae [/b]dwindles by [b]2-10[/b] points per second. When it dries up, sunlight becomes [b]scorching[/b]. *[/li]
[li][b]Forsaken: [/b]Void of divine grace, [b]Restoration [/b]healing effects have no effect on you. Skilled practitioners of a certain perfectly valid school of magic can learn to negate this effect. *[/li]
[li][b]No regeneration: [/b]Vampire's [b]Health [/b]does not regenerate naturally. Any effects boosting [b]Health[/b] [b]regeneration[/b] have no effect, unless [b]Vigor Mortis [/b]is active.[/li]
[/ul]

[ul]
[li][b]Vampiric Drain[/b]: absorb [b]5 (Sated) - 15 (Bloodstarved) Health [/b]and[b] 10 - 20 Vitae [/b]from target. Effectiveness grows up to [b]50%[/b] with [b]Vampirism[/b] skill level.[/li]
[li][b]Vampire's Seduction[/b]: Once a day, silently bewitches a person, calming them and allowing you to feed. Works on targets whose level does not exceed your [b]Vampirism[/b] skill. Target must be facing and detecting you.[/li]
[li][b]Vampire's Sight[/b]: Improved night vision, that adapts to light level of the environment. *[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Vampiric Drain[/b] is envisioned as a core part of toolkit. It has interactions with other spells and restores [b]Vitae[/b] alongside [b]Health[/b], making it even harder to balance properly. For this reason, it cannot be cast from both hands at the same time outside of dual casting. This can be toggled off in the MCM.

[b]Vampiric Rank (Age)[/b]

A newborn fledgling, even one sired by a member of royal bloodline, takes on the full brunt of Molag's curse, yet enjoys little of its benefits. As the unlife goes on, it adapts to the vampiric condition - an experienced hunter, older vampire is certainly a force not to be trifled with. 
A dexterous night hunter, vampire moves 5% ([b]Fledgling[/b]) - 25% ([b]Nightmaster[/b]) faster, and effective Sneak skill is [b]10 - 40 [/b]points higher. Several acquired powers and abilities also improve with age.

[ul]
[li][b]Fledgling[/b]: the beginning of an eternal journey.[/li]
[/ul]
[ul]
[li][b]Blooded [/b](5 days total): Vampire can sense presence of the living nearby with [b]Blood Sense[/b]. When feeding on fresh blood, it may be able to hear [b]Psychic Echoes [/b]of victim's mind.[/li]
[li][b]Mistwalker[/b] (20 days total): Vampire gains [b]Darkwing Dash[/b], a bizarre but notorious power to dissipate into a cloud of bats.[/li]
[li][b]Nightstalker[/b]  (50 days total): Growing resilience helps stave off effects of the sun for longer, granting a [b]Twilight Lurker[/b] ability.[/li]
[li][b]Nightlord[/b]  (100 days total): With age, vampire achieves greater control over its urges. [b]Hunger[/b] progression is now slowed.[/li]
[li][b]Nightmaster[/b] (175 days total): This is the last [b]Rank [/b]a vampire can realistically ascend to within mortal (gamesave) lifespan. Most of the vampiric powers abilities are tremendously enhanced.[/li]
[/ul]

Powers mentioned:
[ul]
[li][b]Blood Sense[/b]: Sense the presence of living within [b]120[/b] feet. Within [b]30[/b] feet, you can discern the quality of nourishment offered by person's blood. Costs 5 [b]Vitae[/b] to maintain, unless [b]Blood-starved[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Psychic Echoes[/b]: Fresh blood brims with echoes of life's journey. If there is a skill in which the victim is significantly more proficient, your own skill may improve based on the difference. Only works once per person.[/li]
[li][b]Darkwing Dash[/b]: Dissipate into a cloud of bats to become invulnerable and receive a movement speed boost for [b]3 [/b]seconds.[/li]
[li][b]Twilight Lurker[/b]: Nighttime lingers for [b]1 [/b]more hour after sunrise, and starts [b]1[/b] hour earlier before nightfall.[/li]
[/ul]

Ageing occurs naturally as time passes. Each time you [b]Drain [/b]mortal's life, the counter advances for [b]1 [/b]day. [b]Diablerie [/b](draining a vampire) advances your age, based on level difference. Ageing rate can be adjusted in MCM.


[b]Hunger and Blood[/b]

[b]Blood as resource[/b]

Most vampiric powers run on stolen blood, in the form of [b]Vitae[/b]. This resource does not regenerate naturally, and can only be replenished by feeding on a living mortal or directly absorbing lifeforce through other means. Vampire starts its journey with a very limited capacity to hold Vitae in their system, and it grows naturally as they advance in [b]Rank[/b]. However, this is not the only way to expand it. Feeding on fresh blood temporarily boosts [b]Vitae [/b]capacity by a certain percent of victim's health. This bonus deteriorates over time, but a small percentage of it will absorbed permanently by the Vampire over time. 
 
[b][color=#ff5f54]IMPORTANT[/color][/b] - the temporary Vitae Bonus does [b]NOT [/b]compound. Each time you bite, if the potential new bonus amount is smaller than current bonus, current bonus stays the same. Meaning, to increase your current bonus, you must feed on someone who can provide a bonus bigger than your current. Details on how the bonus is calculated can be found below in the [b]Feeding [/b]section.

[b][color=#e82a1f]IMPORTANT 2 [/color][/b][color=#e82a1f][color=#000000]- When you try to cast certain [b]Vitae costing [/b]spells, such as those that are equipped in hands, and do not have enough[b] Vitae[/b], cost system is implemented in such a way that you would get a "[b]Not enough Magicka[/b]" notification and you [b]Magicka bar [/b]would flash, as if you do not have enough mana to cast it. This is a nuance of implementation, that I am hoping to change and make more immersive in a future update.[/color][/color] 

Current [b]Vitae [/b]levels can be seen on the [b]Vitae bar [/b](new UI element, similar to vanilla health bar). Color of the right end of the bar ranges from [b]violet [/b]to [b]bright orange[/b], meaning to represent how much [b]Vitae Bonus [/b]you currently have relative the base [b]Vitae [/b](permanently absorbed bonus is added to base value). Bar's position on screen, as well as scale and some other characteristics can be adjusted in the MCM. See the [b]Vitae[/b] magic effect in magic effects menu to know exact numbers.

If [b]Vitae [/b]drops below 0, all effects that require it to maintain end immediately and have to be recast (except [b]Vigor Mortis[/b]), when [b]Vitae [/b]becomes available again.

[b]Feeding[/b]

Consequently, blood drinking is more than a daily chore. Mortals come in all sorts of flavors, and so does their essence - seek out and feed on potent blood to grow stronger over time, or sip on those Volkihar stable capri-suns and miss out on your potential.

In [b]Everdamned[/b], there are different ways to sate the thirst:
[ul]
[li][b]Vampire's Seduction[/b]: Silently bewitches a person, calming them and allowing you to feed.  Temporarily boosts [b]Vitae[/b] by [b]20%[/b] of victim's [b]Health[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Thralls[/b]: Volkihar castle maintains a stable of thralls. Feeding on them temporarily boosts [b]Vitae[/b] by [b]20%[/b] of victim's [b]Health[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Sleeping[/b]: Sneak into someone's domicile to feed on them in their sleep. Temporarily boosts [b]Vitae[/b] by[b] 30%[/b] of victim's [b]Health.[/b][/li]
[li][b]Charm (Eyes of the Moon perk)[/b]: With a little touch of vampiric charm, seduce your way to victim's throat through conversation. A large number of factors determines the likelihood of a success.  Temporarily boosts [b]Vitae[/b] by[b] 30%[/b] (first success) to [b]50%[/b] (Blood Doll) of victim's [b]Health[/b], depending on how many times they were successfully seduced.[/li]
[li][b]Drain[/b]: If your bite was lethal, temporarily boosts [b]Vitae [/b]by[b] 50%[/b] of victim's [b]Health. [/b]Act of draining another [b]Vampire[/b] is called [b]Diablerie[/b], and is only possible through combat at first.[/li]
[/ul]

After feeding, victims need time to replenish the vital liquid. Recuperation period depends on how large was the [b]% [/b]of [b]Health[/b] used for [b]Vitae [/b]boost. [b]Draining[/b] is still possible regardless.

[b]Combat Drain[/b]

In combat, special circumstance allow your to finish off an enemy with a lethal drain. [b]Combat Drain [/b]becomes available, if your victim is below a certain [b]Health[/b] threshold, or bleeding out. A visual effect above the target will play to indicate that. 

To perform a [b]Combat Drain, [/b]activate the target, while standing still. In some cases (mostly due to Bethesda jank) the animation cannot be played and your grasp will slip, prompting a notification. In general, you must be standing on roughly the same height level as the target, and there should not be any other objects obstructing the space between you. Some strategies to circumvent Skyrim engine jank were implemented, but they can only get you so far without making the game unstable.

[b][color=#ff5f54]KEEP IN MIND[/color] - [/b]unlike regular killmoves,[b] Combat Drain[/b] does [b]not[/b] make you invulnerable for its duration.

[b]Avoiding detection[/b]

As a general rule, feeding in presence other non-vampires will not go unnoticed. If you are caught in the act, it would be considered physical assault and raise an alarm. Lethal [b]drains [/b]would earn you a murder charge. To spot you, bystanders must be conscious, detect and have a line of sight on you, while being within a certain distance. This distance depends mainly on the[b] light level [/b]at the time of the act. In general, you should avoid biting people in public in broad daylight. However, [b]Charm[/b] offers opportunities to feed discreetly in circumstances that otherwise would be too revealing.

[b]Charm (Eyes of the Moon perk)[/b]

A vampire does not always have to resort to violence or stealth to sate its thirst. Charming your prey with witty banter and a little touch of hypnosis will earn you an opportunity to take their blood peacefully, leaving them with a vague pleasant memories and blissfully unaware of any biting or feeding taking place. The quality of nourishment offered by their blood becomes significantly higher as well. Each time you successfully Charm a person, their blood becomes more attuned to you, eventually leading them to become your [b]Blood Doll[/b]. [b]Blood Doll'[/b]s blood is highly nutritious. So far, this is the only effect of [b]Blood Doll [/b]status.

Success in seduction depends on how eloquent you are (your [b]Speechcraft[/b] level), weighted against your [b]relationship[/b] with the person you are trying to seduce. The closer is your relationship, the greater are your chances. Charming a complete stranger is a tall order - something only a true master of speech could pull off, so consider putting in the legwork to befriend them first.
However, there are many other influencing factors - including what you’re wearing, where you are, you and your prey's social standing, its mood, allegiances, and much more. Best way to become better at this IS [b]doing it[/b], and paying attention to the cues in form of the dialogue during and after the act. Also, you will have a power to [b]Ruminate [/b](castable power, available in magic menu) on your past experiences, during which you will also get valuable feedback and advice on how to best develop you allure.

When vampire feeds on a willing target this way, it is much easier to conceal as mere harmless flirtations. For example, an [b]inn[/b]/[b]tavern [/b]is a place where such socialization is natural and excepted, and noone would be suspicious unless you decide to feed literally in front of them. On the contrary, doing that out in the open street would be much harder to conceal, so its best to find a safe spot away from accidental bystanders.

[b]Blue Blood [/b]

Mechanically it is a copy of Sacrosanct namesake feature, but with completely different rewards in mind.

After draining a life for the first time, a new quest would start, tasking you to taste the blood of Skyrim's greatest. Tasting them is worthwhile, because with their blood you will absorb an echo of their extraordinarily lived lives (a number of skill points unique for each Blue Blood flagged NPC). Apart from that, after a second "blue blood" feeding, a new mechanic will be introduced - check spoiler to spoil it.

[spoiler]
At [b]2[/b] "blue blood" feedings, you will aquire a [b]Chained Beast[/b] ability. It is a mechanic, similar to [b]Fortitude [/b]from [b]Sacrosanct[/b], but with a twist. When you are at [b]Stage 1[/b] hunger and are felled, instead of dying like a chump you get a second chance. But this chance comes at a cost - you drop to [b]Blood-starved[/b] and awaken your Beast. Unless you exit the combat or feed promptly, you will be forcefully transformed into a [b]Vampire Fleder Beast[/b]. To revert the transformation, you will have to quench the Beast's thirst by feeding - either through [b]Combat Drain[/b], which is still available in this transformation, or on a corpse.

At [b]8 [/b]"blue blood" feedings, you will be able to attain greater control over your urges and rein in the Beast, transforming [b]Chained Beast [/b]into [b]Embrace the Beast[/b]. With it, there will be no more forced transformations, and it will function as a regular second chance mechanic, albeit still dropping you to [b]Bloodstarved[/b]. Additionally, you will gain an ability to transform to and from [b]Fleder [/b]at will, making it an essentially second vampiric transformation.

I've always really enjoyed werewolf form, it has a great melee play, far superior to that of a Vampire Lord. HOWEVER, vampires are really my thing and I like them better. So I felt like I'm missing out because i'd almost never got the chance to run around as werewolf. This feature is an attempt to remedy that, giving access to gameplay- and lore-friendly way to transform into a [b]werewolf skeleton and animations based [/b]race, while still being a part of a larger picture of being a vampire. Transformation retains access to all vampiric powers and abilities, but not spells, for self-explanatory reasons. Killing mortal NPCs with left hand killmove (where the werewolf/Fleder devours the victim) counts as feeding, [b]Combat Drain [/b]through activation uses this animation as well.

At [b]10 [/b]"blue blood" feedings, you will recieve [b]3[/b] perk points to spend in regular skill trees.

If you experience compatibility issues with the second chance mechanic (like you have another mod with a similar feature of just don't like it), it can be turned off in the MCM. Forced transformation is also toggleable.
[/spoiler] 


[b]Hunger Stages[/b]

Vampires are ravenously hungry creatures. With each passing day without feeding, [b]Hunger [/b]will advance one [b]Stage[/b], on average. Hungrier vampires become less able to use their powers in general, as [b]Vitae [/b]capacity shrinks. However, the growing bloodlust makes them more voracious, increasing the power of [b]Vampiric Drain [/b]and making it easier to perform a [b]Combat Drain[/b].

[b]Hunger[/b] has [b]4 [/b]distinct[b] Stages[/b]:
[ul]
[li][b]Sated[/b]: 100% [b]Vitae [/b]capacity; [b]Combat Drain [/b]threshold is [b]25% Health[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Thirsty[/b]: 70% [b]Vitae [/b]capacity; [b]Combat Drain [/b]threshold is [b]30% Health[/b]; [b]Vampiric Drain [/b]base damage increased by [b]3[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Parched[/b]: 50% [b]Vitae [/b]capacity;[b] Combat Drain [/b]threshold is [b]40% Health[/b];  [b]Vampiric Drain [/b]base damage increased by [b]6[/b]; Cannot [b]Feed [/b]without [b]Draining[/b];[/li]
[li][b]Blood-starved[/b]: 40% [b]Vitae [/b]capacity; [b]Combat Drain [/b]threshold is [b]50% Health[/b];[b] Vampiric Drain [/b]base damage increased by [b]10[/b]; Cannot [b]Feed [/b]without [b]Draining; Bloodsense [/b]is free of cost. [/li]
[/ul]

When [b]Bloodstarved[/b], your vampiric nature is apparent, and you become [b]hated [/b]and attacked on sight by the common folk. All forms of feeding reset hunger back to [b]Stage 1[/b].


[b]Vampire and the Sun[/b]

In sunny weather, [b]Health[/b], [b]Magicka[/b] and [b]Stamina[/b] are lowered by [b]25 (Sated) - 100 (Blood-starved) [/b]points. In direct sunlight, their regeneration is halted, and[b] Vitae [/b]dwindles by [b]2-10[/b] points per second. When it dries up, sunlight becomes [b]scorching[/b], which is a nice way of saying that you catch fire like a matchstick. 

As long as Auri-El keeps peeping unto Nirn through that dastardly hole in the sky, vampires will have to endure its unyielding presence. Much to Harkon's eternal disappointment, there is no way to become a true daywalker, completely immune to its effects. Every day, from 6 AM up until 7 PM direct sunshine is intense enough to harm a vampire. However, it may become obstructed by present weather conditions. Who needs to blot out the sun with an ancient prophecy, when Skyrim's own natural climate can make you forget what daylight is supposed to look like? All in all, a well-fed vampire that has some [b]Vitae [/b]to spare can brave the sun with little actual consequence and run errands or even travel normally during the day. However, the pressure to seek shelter will still always be present.

Important notes concerning fast travel: if you fast travel while in direct sunlight and arrive at your destination while in the direct sunlight, game will treat it as if you where fast travelling under direct sunlight for the whole duration of the travel - in practice, that means you will arrive with [b]0[/b] [b]Vitae[/b]. This is not a problem per se, as it makes perfect sense as in "travel long under sunlight and get burned", but, unfortunately, I am unable to provide an MCM option to make regular fast travel completely safe at all times. Thankfully, i found a way to exclude [b]carriage/ferry[/b] (and other forms of sitting fast) [b]travel[/b] from this behavior (let's say that paid travel services come with a parasol).


[b]Vampirism skill tree[/b]

Thanks to CommonlibSSE and new generation of revolutionary modding resources, namely [b]Custom Skills Framework [/b]by [b]meh321[/b] and [b]Parapets[/b], vampires can finally have a dedicated fluid skill progression. No longer is it necessary to cram everything in Vampire Lord perk tree, leaving it free to focus on enhancing Vampire Lord gameplay!

[b]Vampirism [/b]skill offers three distinct branches to developing your undead prowess in. [b]Vampirism [/b]perk points are separate from regular vanilla perk [b]AND [/b]from Vampire Lord tree. Freshly turned vampires begin with [b]2 Vampirism [/b]perk points ready to invest. You get a new perk point every [b]5 Vampirism [/b]skill levels, and [b]2[/b] more each time you advance in [b]Rank[/b], for a total of [b]30 [/b]points. That means, the entirety of the [b]Vampirism [/b]tree is unlockable in one playthrough, but that would require the player to reach both maximum skill level and ascend to highest [b]Rank[/b], making the choice of order in which you unlock perks a little more meaningful.

By default, [b]Vampirism [/b]skill does not contribute to player [b]level [/b]progression. That can be adjusted in MCM. If you set the multiplier to 1, that make [b]Vampirism [/b]contribute the same[b] level XP [/b]as regular skills. This multiplier is [b]not [/b]retroactive.
A lot of perks come with abilities that let you read a more detailed description of their current effect on your character. Navigate to the Magic Effects menu to see them.

The central branch offers ways to develop the archetypical vampiric traits of supernatural [b]strength[/b], [b]speed[/b] and [b]resilience[/b]. Batter enemies with more force than ever before! Run faster and jump higher than a mere mortal ever could! Shrug off heaviest blows like it's nothing, leave foes biting dust or omae wa mou shindeiru them with blinding speed and razor-sharp reflexes, while keeping things balanced by managing [b]Vitae [/b]levels.

[ul]
[li][b]Fortitude - Vigor Mortis[/b]: Use blood that you have taken to bring vitality back to your flesh and repair damaged tissue - Health regenerates at rate of [b]1.5%[/b] + [b]0.2%[/b] per each[b] Vampiric Rank[/b] per second. Other sources of boosting Health [b]regeneration[/b] become effective again. Halts when on fire or in direct sunlight. (Cost to maintain: [b]4 Vitae[/b] when actively regenerating)[/li]
[li][b]Reflexes - Extended Perception[/b]: Your awareness sharpens and reflex becomes uncannily precise. Hold Hotkey A to toggle this power on or off. (Cost to maintain: [b]8 Vitae[/b]) [/li]
[li][b]Potence - Deadly Strength[/b]: Vampiric strength is as feared as it is supernatural. You passively deal more damage, carry more weight, take less fall damage and can charge a jump by holding [b]Hotkey B[/b]. Effects grow with age. Activate this power to increase your overall physical damage by an additional [b]40%[/b] (Costing to maintain: [b]10 Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Fortitude - Necrotic Flesh[/b]: Your dead flesh hardens, becoming akin to a gargoyle's hide. You take less damage from each physical attack, Fire and Shock resistance is [b]40%[/b] higher. However, you are encumbered, slowing you by [b]60%[/b] and making it impossible to sprint and jump high. Effects grow with age. (Cost to maintain: [b]20 Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Reflexes - Celerity[/b]: For [b]4[/b] seconds you move with speed so great that to those around you appear as nothing but a blur. Effect grows with age. Tap [b]Hotkey A[/b] to activate, hold to dispel prematurely. (Cost: [b]400 Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Potence - Ferocious Surge[/b]: Through channeling your inner Beast you can push your body beyond all physical limits. For [b]4[/b] seconds you become almost completely tireless, attack [b]20% faster[/b] and your melee attacks hit all targets in front of you. Lasts longer with age, up to [b]13[/b] seconds. (Cost: [b]600 Vitae[/b]) [/li]
[li][b]Potence - Impetus[/b]: When in [b]Celerity[/b] and [b]Deadly Strength[/b] are active, power attacks from behind take an enemy by surprise and carry such momentum they become critical and launch target forward.[/li]
[li][b]Reflexes - Wicked Wind[/b]: Ultimate expression of vampiric swiftness - in a blink of an eye, appear at target location within 15 feet. Castable only in Celerity. Tapping [b]Hotkey A[/b] during [b]Celerity [/b]casts this instead of [b]Celerity[/b]. [/li]
[/ul]

Leftmost branch of [b]Vampirism [/b]skill tree focuses primarily on [b]stealth [/b]related mechanics, blending in with society and thus making [b]feeding [/b]easier. The power to influence mortal minds and bend their will lies here.

[ul]
[li][b]Eyes of the Moon[/b]: In conversation, your hypnotic gaze may help you seduce victims and feed on them discreetly. Feeding this way produces a bigger bonus to [b]Vitae[/b] than through [b]Vampire's Seduction[/b]. Bystanders might see through the act, raising alarm. Use [b]Ruminate[/b] to reflect on how to best develop your allure.[/li]
[li][b]Vampire's Will[/b]: Directs attention of a living creature away from you for [b]60[/b] seconds. They are less likely to detect you sneaking, and are oblivious to you feeding on others. Master practitioners of School of Illusion can learn to affect Daedra and Undead. Only works on [b]1[/b] target at a time.[/li]
[li][b]Presence[/b]: Your vampiric influence makes Illusion spells up to [b]40%[/b] stronger and longer, depending on [b]Vampirism[/b] skill progress. [b]Vampire's Seduction[/b] works on targets [b]20[/b] levels higher, if they are affected by a [b]Calm[/b] spell. Makes intimidation attempts twice as likely to succeed.[/li]
[li][b]Mesmerize[/b]: Increases duration of [b]Vampire's Seduction[/b] by [b]30[/b] seconds and up to [b]3[/b] minutes total, depending on [b]Vampirism[/b] skill progress. You now can apply it when seducing through conversation instead of feeding, free of cooldown. Affected, if asked, will follow you, unless you move too far away from them.[/li]
[li][b]Confusion[/b]: [b]Vampire's Will[/b] can now put a humanoid target in a state of [b]Confusion[/b], creating a distraction that would gather attention of nearby people. Only [b]1[/b] target can be [b]Confused[/b] at the same time, and targets become immune to it for a while afterwards. Player must be sneaking and undetected to apply this effect.[/li]
[li][b]Instinctive Charm[/b]: Upon receiving an unblocked hit, there is a small chance you will retaliate with a [b]Calming[/b] charm. Effect lasts [b]15[/b] seconds and has [b]30[/b] seconds cooldown per person. Only works if attacking group in no smaller than [b]2[/b] members. Effect can be toggled off.[/li]
[li][b]Dream Visitor[/b]: Feeding on a sleeping person makes them imprint on you in their dream. Your relationship rank with them increases by [b]1[/b]. Only works once per person.[/li]
[li][b]Obfuscate[/b]: Blend into your surroundings, gaining unbreakable invisibility for [b]60[/b] seconds while sneaking. [b]Nightstalker[/b] vampires and older do not have to sneak. Ends immediately when hit. (Cost: [b]300[/b] [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Masquerade[/b]: Constant low-level charm hides your vampiric features even when they are most apparent. You are no longer hated when [b]Blood-starved[/b]. It becomes easier to feed without arousing suspicion, and detection radius becomes three times lower.[/li]
[li][b]Dominate[/b]: Bend mortals to your will. When [b]Dominate[/b] is active, you may command any mortal to [b]Stay[/b], [b]Follow[/b], [b]Flee[/b] or be [b]Mesmerized[/b], which places them under the effect of [b]Vampire's Seduction[/b]. Applied this way, it works on targets up to 50 levels higher. Lasts [b]60[/b] seconds. (Cost: [b]400[/b] [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[/ul]

Rightmost branch is dedicated to various applications of Blood magic, centered around deepening your understanding of the secrets that blood holds through the art of Hemomancy. Hemomancy offers ways to deal magic damage over time, enhance your survivability and [b]Vitae [/b]management, and even some opportunities for crowd control. All Hemomancy spells require[b] no Magicka[/b] to cast, but cost [b]Vitae[/b] instead. Access to higher tiers of Hemomancy spells lets you annihilate enemies in a spectacular fashion, but cost a lot of [b]Vitae[/b]. Hemomancy is designed to supplement the general gameplay and offer powerful, but truly costly magic options, which may be difficult to achieve with Magicka based spells while keeping things balanced.
On top of that, this branch offers a novel way to [b]feed [/b]through [b]Exsanguination[/b], that makes it possible to get most effects of a feeding out of non-humanoid creatures.

[ul]
[li][b]Hemomancy[/b]: Drain a life to unlock this perk and the secret art of Hemomancy, starting with the [b]Blood Seed[/b] spell. Hemomancy grows up to [b]50%[/b] stronger with Vampirism skill progression. Most Hemomancy spells have no effect on dwarven automata, ghosts or skeletons.[/li]
[li][b]Bloodletting[/b]: When you apply [b]Vampiric Drain[/b], all targets affected by [b]Blood Seed[/b] within 20 feet are also drained for [b]5[/b] Health and [b]Vitae[/b] per second.[/li]
[li][b]Adept Hemomancy[/b]: Using Hemomancy in combat leads to discovery of new spells when you drain a life. Practice the art of Hemomancy to uncover secrets of [b]Blood Brand[/b],[b] Blood Garden[/b] spells and [b]Maw[/b] ability.[/li]
[li][b]Exsanguinate[/b]: [b]Vampiric Drain[/b] can now be dual cast. Maintaining an unbroken channel on a target that has less than [b]25%[/b] Health left will [b]exsanguinate[/b] it, killing it and counting as feeding. [b]Vitae [/b]capacity cannot be extended this way. Target of the channel cannot die until it is complete or the channel is broken.[/li]
[li][b]Transfusion[/b]: When cast at an ally, instead of regular effects [b]Blood Brand[/b] heals them for [b]150[/b] health over [b]2[/b] seconds. If you are sneaking, applies regular [b]Blood Brand[/b] effects.[/li]
[li][b]Expert Hemomancy[/b]: Your understanding of secrets of the blood grows further still. New spells of [b]Blood Scourge[/b] and [b]Blood Ankh[/b], as well as [b]Blood Tendril[/b] ability can now be learned through continued practice.[/li]
[li][b]Kindred[/b]: [b]Transfusion[/b] now also makes its target immune to all other effects of Hemomancy for [b]8[/b] seconds.[/li]
[li][b]Vicissitude[/b]: Hemomancy spells do [b]25%[/b] more damage in form of Health absorption to targets, affected by [b]Blood Seed[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Blood Resonance[/b]: Melee hits on targets affected by a Hemomancy spell regenerate [b]30[/b] [b]Vitae[/b] over [b]2[/b] seconds. During that time, [b]Vampiric Drain[/b] is [b]50%[/b] more effective.[/li]
[li][b]Master Hemomancy[/b]: Learn how truly devastating mastery over blood can be by discovering [b]Blood Vortex[/b], [b]Blood Boil[/b] and [b]Borrowed Time[/b] spells.[/li]
[/ul]

Hemomancy spells list is expanded compared with Sacrosanct. Blood Brand is reworked completely, and Blood Scourge is streamlined to cast Blood Ankh when it is possible, instead of it being a separate spell. Complete list of Hemomancy spells and abilities:

[ul]
[li][b]Blood Seed[/b]: Jagged bone shards grow in a living or undead target, dealing [b]4[/b] magic damage for 10 seconds. (Cost: [b]20[/b] [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Blood Brand[/b]: Inflicts [b]Blood Seed[/b], causing [b]10[/b] magic damage for [b]12[/b] seconds. Cast on a corpse to oversaturate its flesh with stolen blood, igniting it and creating a large pyre that lasts [b]45[/b] seconds and burns enemies for [b]15[/b] magic damage. Modified by [b]Transfusion[/b], [b]Kindred[/b] and [b]Blood Tendril[/b]. (Cost: 50 [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Blood Garden[/b]: Casts [b]Blood Seed[/b] on all targets, inflicting [b]8[/b] magic damage for [b]10[/b] seconds. (Cost: [b]80[/b] [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Maw[/b]: [b]Vampiric Drain[/b] is [b]25%[/b] more effective, or [b]50%[/b] more effective if you have less than [b]50%[/b] [b]Vitae[/b], on targets affected by [b]Blood Seed[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Blood Scourge[/b]: Living or undead target takes [b]15[/b] magic damage for [b]15[/b] seconds. On death, spreads to all nearby targets. (Cost: [b]200[/b] [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Blood Ankh[/b]: [b]Blood Scourge[/b] can now be aimed at a corpse or friendly controlled undead. Cast this way, it places a hex, that after a brief delay causes target to explode for [b]200[/b] magic damage.[/li]
[li][b]Blood Tendril[/b]: A [b]Blood Tendril[/b] lashes out periodically from the pyre, created by [b]Blood Brand[/b]. Those hit are dealt [b]100[/b] magic damage and knocked prone.[/li]
[li][b]Blood Vortex[/b]: Perform a profane ritual to conjure a blood storm, covering a [b]20 [/b]feet area,  for [b]30 [/b]seconds. Victims suffer [b]5[/b] magic damage. Storm claims those who perish to last [b]10[/b] more seconds. After [b]4[/b] claimed deaths it saturates fully and rebirths as [b]Profaned Sun[/b] that burns for [b]25[/b] magic damage per second for [b]15[/b] seconds and follows last [b]Blood Branded[/b] target. (Cost: 300 [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Blood Boil[/b]: A living target burns for [b]5[/b] magic damage for [b]12[/b] seconds. At half Health, blood boils in their veins, leading to an unpreventable violent explosion that knocks everyone down and deals [b]500[/b] magic damage in a large area. Only [b]1[/b] victim can burn at a time. (Cost: 600 [b]Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Borrowed Time[/b]: Deals [b]5[/b] magic damage for [b]20[/b] seconds to a living or undead target. When time runs out, deals damage equal to all [b]Health[/b] lost by the target during this time. (Cost: <400> Vitae)[/li]
[/ul]

Inter-branch perks:
[ul]
[li][b]Preservation[/b]: Learn to create [b]Blood Potions[/b] by drawing them from thralls or by cooking station recipes. Skilled alchemists will be able to refine the formula to produce a much more potent [b]Blood Wine[/b]*. Requires [b]Vigor Mortis [/b]and [b]Hemomancy [/b]perks to be unlocked.[/li]
[li][b]Auspex[/b]: In mortal form, your supernatural senses warn you of the presence of enemies within 70 feet, briefly illuminating them through walls. Enemies can only be illuminated once and enemies that are too close are not detected. Requires [b]Extended Perception [/b]and [b]Presence [/b]to be unlocked.[/li]
[/ul]

[b]Hotkeys[/b]

[b]Everdamned [/b]makes two hotkeys available, referenced as[b] Hotkey A [/b]and [b]Hotkey B[/b]. By default, they are bound to the [b]X [/b]and [b]V [/b]buttons, but can be remapped in MCM. 
Effects of these hotkeys, however, cannot be altered. They are mostly meant to streamline access to toggleable abilities (it is a great hassle to manage them otherwise), and give access to the Charged Jump mechanic.
Effects of these Hotkeys are as follows:

[ul]
[li][b]Hotkey A[/b]: Hold to toggle [b]Extended Perception[/b]. Tap to cast [b]Celerity[/b]. Tap when in [b]Celerity [/b]to cast [b]Wicked Wind[/b]. [b]LSHIFT [/b]+ Tap to cast [b]Darkwing Dash[/b].[/li]
[li][b]Hotkey B[/b]: Tap to toggle [b]Deadly Strength[/b]. [b]LSHIFT [/b]+ Tap to toggle [b]Necrotic Flesh[/b]. Hold to [b]Charge Jump[/b].[/li]
[/ul]

Any effects listed will only be applied if player has them unlocked already. For example, you cannot cast [b]Celerity[/b], if you have not yet unlocked the respective perk.


[b]Vampire Lord [/b]

First and foremost, you are a[b] Volkihar [/b]vampire, and Vampire Lord form is an ultimate expression of that. Lore suggests this vampires of this lineage are uniquely gifted in the arts of Necromancy, they can hide under the sheet of ice and grab prey from under it and also their breath is icy? Regardless, it is not really reflected in vanilla gameplay options. Now, Vampire Lords have access to more necromancy options, as well as a summoner-like archetype, to put an emphasis on the Lord part. Additionally, this bloodline is a direct gift from Molag Bal itself, so some new powers are inspired by that connection to Coldharbour. 
Overall, playing as Vampire Lord should feel powerful and worthy of the title. It is not a solution for every situation and cannot be used in every scenario, but when the time is right, it should feel fun without being overpowered. To make magic form less of a spamfest, Vampiric Drain was slightly nerfed to make way for other spells and abilities. Melee-focused powers from [b]Vampirism [/b]tree, as well as from Vampire Lord's own tree, will give you more reasons to descend.

Basic Vampire Lord spells:
[ul]
[li][b]Vampiric Drain[/b]: Explosion of vampiric energy that absorbs [b]10 (level 0)[/b] - [b]16 (level 50) Health [/b]and [b]Vitae[/b] and deals [b]25[/b] - [b]40[/b] magic damage.[/li]
[li][b]Lord's Servant[/b]: Reanimate [color=#000000]a corpse up to level [b]13[/b] for [b]10 [/b]minutes.[/color][/li]
[li][color=#000000][b]Bats[/b]: Dash in your direction of movement. Has [b]2[/b] charges.[/color][/li]
[/ul]

When in Vampire Lord form, you are hated as if [b]Blood-starved[/b], and direct sunlight is immediately [b]scorching [/b]irrespective of current [b]Vitae [/b]level. 

Can you feel the power of the ancient blood coursing through your veins yet? Acquaint yourself with a selection of [b]23 [/b]more perks, available for purchase in the [b]Vampire Lord[/b] form. Perk points here are separate from [b]Vampirism [/b]perk tree, and can be obtained through traditional method of absorbing victim Lifeblood by biting them or killing with form's version of [b]Vampiric Drain[/b]. Biting produces [b]3 [/b]times more Lifeblood than killing with a drain spell. A number of Vampire Lord perk points is awarded when you advance in [b]Rank[/b] - [b]2 [/b]for each. 

[ul]
[li][b]Royal Bloodline[/b]: All attributes (Health, Magicka, Stamina) are increased by [b]50[/b] points as Vampire Lord. Choose an attribute to further increase by [b]100[/b] points.[/li]

[b]Vampiric Drain[/b] costs [b]50%[/b] less Magicka in mortal form. [b]Lord's Servant[/b] can now raise corpses of level equal to your [b]Vampirism[/b] skill. Grants access to a lesser version of [b]Lord's Servant[/b] in mortal form.[/li]

[li][b]Wings of the Strix[/b]: In magic mode, sprinting allows you to glide, greatly reducing fall speed.[/li]
[li][b]Night Cloak[/b]: In combat, you are surrounded by a cloud of bats that feed on living enemies within melee range, absorbing [b]5[/b] points of Health per second from each. Weakened foes suffer reduced damage, but may get staggered instead.[/li]
[li][b]Raze[/b]: Cast a wave of blood that cuts through targets in a line, absorbing [b]15[/b] - [b]25[/b] Health and dealing [b]35[/b] - [b]60[/b] additional magic damage, based on your level. Permanently replaces standard Vampire Lord right hand spell.[/li]

[li][b]Subjugate Undead[/b]: [b]Lord's Servant[/b] spell now allows you to dominate a weaker hostile undead, placing it under your command. You can only have [b]1[/b] target under your control this way. Does not count against summon limit. [b]Vampire's Will [/b]now works on undead. (Cost: [b]200 Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Marching Flesh[/b]: Channel necrotic energy to empower commanded undead for [b]30[/b] Health per second and [b]30%[/b] movement speed. Exposure for [b]6[/b] seconds grants them [b]Unholy Strength[/b]. It increases Health and Stamina by [b]50[/b], attack speed for [b]20%[/b] for [b]15[/b] seconds, and resets reanimation duration. (Cost: [b]30 Magicka[/b], [b]30 Vitae[/b])[/li]
[li][b]Undying Loyalty[/b]: Charge [b]Lord's Servant[/b] for [b]3[/b] seconds to increase its magnitude [b]twofold[/b], and make reanimated thrall last indefinitely and not disintegrate on death.

[/ul]

[b]Compatibility[/b]

[b][color=#c10300]Hard incompatibility:[/color] [/b]other Vampire Overhauls, like Sacrosanct, Vampiric Thirst ports, Better Vampires etc. They are meant to modify same gameplay elements and would break each other.
[color=#008e02][b]Compatible: [/b][color=#000000]mods that modify Vampire appearance, like DVA, Vampire Lord Overhaul etc. Everdamned does not edit any vanilla race or NPC records to keep it as compatible with such mods as possible.[/color][/color]
[color=#e8c500][b]Partially Compatible[/b]: [color=#000000]other mods, related to feeding, like Vampire Feeding Tweaks or Vampire Animations. Everdamned already covers feeding mechanics extensively, plus in vanilla feeding the game does not have info about the victim, so it is not possible to calculate Vitae bonus and etc. Compatibility patches will have to be made, feel free to request some/ask about compatibility in the posts tab. A general compatibility patch with all of them is planned.[/color][/color]
[color=#e86e04][b]Not Recommended: [/b][color=#000000]These mods will not irreparably break the game if installed with Everdamned, but some bad interactions are known to happen, so hence this list:[/color][/color]
[ul]
[li][color=#000000][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345][b]Wheeler[/b][/url] - it has a bug that breaks the game timescale, if you open Wheeler menu during a Slow Time effect. It is a bug of a wheeler and cannot be fixed on Everdamned side, and Everdamned features time slow effects, so that might become an issue. But, the problem fixes itself once the Time Slow effect ends, so Wheeler still can be used, albeit with caution.[/color][/li]
[li][color=#000000][b]ENB presets[/b] - most ENB presets are known to cause problems with color modifying part of Imagespace Modifiers. Everdamned features Imagespace Modifiers for spells and powers VFX, so you might not get the intended look. Same goes for most other gameplay mods, so unless you are a screen archer and/or need a specific ENB, consider investigating this matter and switching to a preset that does not break Imods, like True Vision. Or, better yet, use Community Shaders.[/color][/li]
[li][color=#000000][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2777?tab=posts][b]Predator Vision[/b][/url][b] - [/b]Everdamned implements similar features in a more performance friendly way, and has them integrated with gameplay mechanics. Also, it seems long abandoned and has several bugs : ([/color][/li]
[li][color=#000000][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117155]Conjuration Limit Fix[/url] [/b]- currently, if Everdamned detects its presence, it shuts off its features regarding unlimited summoning/reanimation mechanics. Integration is planned some time in the future.[/color][/li]
[/ul]

[b]Credits[/b]

All assets are either made by me from vanilla assets or come from mods with open permission (or i asked for permission directly). In latter case, they can be found in a dedicated *_imported folder in /meshes/Everdamned or /textures/Everdamned. Important to note, 90% of them are not copied as is, but modified by me to some degree, sometimes they are not recognizable anymore, but I decided to leave them where they are for convenience.

MissLeeches - it was her mod that awakened the interest for vampiric media in me, that still holds to this day and led to the creation of this mod. also shamelessly stole some cool strings
EnaiSiaion - assets from Sacrosanct, Apocalypse and Ordinator. thanks for all the amazing mods of Enairim as well as Sacrosanct, how do I get off Ordinator, its just so good, someone please help me.
MihailMods - used Fleder from his Vampire Beasts mod and Foglings from Foglings mod. hid mods are a staple of my load order and also seems like a very pleasant guy
KittyTail - learned most of VFX that I can do with NIFs from dissecting their numerous mods of insane quality, also used some assets
noptasis - Arcanum is my favorite spell mod and a huge inspiration, also used some assets

FAQ

Q: No sneak feeding? 
A: Yes, Everdamned does not feature an option to sneak feed. Honestly, I just don't understand the idea of "sneakily feeding on a conscious person". I will try to find a place for it somehow in coming updates, suggestions are welcome.

Q: I want to report a bug/crash.
A: Please describe the circumstances of the problem in as much detail as possible. Make sure to include crash logs in case of a crash and/or Papyrus logs. If you do not have crash logs or do not where to get them, see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818]this mod[/url]. For Papyrus logs, see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/368]this article[/url].

Q: I want to suggest a compatibility patch.
A: Suggestions are welcome, try to describe what mod you want to make Everdamned compatible with is about and which features must be made compatible, so I can prioritize.

Q: Seduction feeding animation / combat drain animation did not play, why?
A: If only I knew why. Sometimes, god knows for what reason, Skyrim engine decides that you cannot play idles (sometimes even solo idles) in this particular spot. Try again in a different spot.


* Direct sunlight represents actual in-game light level. Depending on your lightning mods, presence of ENB/CS and other effects affecting light, shadows you see rendered in-game may not correspond to what the game engine considers shadowed area. If that is the case for you and you feel it breaks your immersion, visit Everdamned MCM menu to make sun weakness not depend on light level. But I think its still fun regardless, so its on by default. Also, you can disable scorching sunlight entirely.
* Restoration Healing penalty is disabled when player gets a certain perk (see spoiler). Also, it can be disabled in MCM for compatibility reasons, like your perk overhaul not using some vanilla perk records/giving them a different name so you can't find them.
[spoiler]Necromage[/spoiler]
* Again, due to inconsistencies with light level based effects, you can disable night vision adaptivity in the MCM and pick a preferred level there.
* There is a secret third effect of [b]Preservation [/b]perk. Check spoiler to see:
[spoiler]If you have progressed Skyrim's main quest far enough and Septimus gave you the [b]Essence Extractor[/b], you can use it on [b]Blood Dolls[/b] to extract a more potent version of [b]Blood Potion[/b]. You do not need to have the item in your inventory to do that. Option to bypass main quest requirement exists in the MCM[/spoiler]
